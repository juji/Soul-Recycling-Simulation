   - ✅ Development logging for debugging

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### LOD Manager Initialization:
```javascript
// Phase 4: Initialize Adaptive Performance Manager
adaptivePerformanceManager = new AdaptivePerformanceManager({
  debug: import.meta.env.DEV,
  enableLearning: true,
  adaptationAggression: 'moderate'
});

// Phase 4: Initialize LOD Manager with camera and performance manager
lodManager = new LODManager(camera, adaptivePerformanceManager);

// Configure LOD distances based on initial hardware quality
const initialQuality = adaptivePerformanceManager.getCurrentQuality();
lodManager.configureForQuality(initialQuality);
```

### Animation Loop Integration:
```javascript
// Phase 4: LOD calculations (before worker update for physics scaling)
if (FEATURE_FLAGS.USE_LOD_SYSTEM && lodManager && souls.length > 0) {
  // Calculate LOD levels for all souls
  lodStats = lodManager.calculateLODLevels(souls);
  
  // Update performance metrics
  lodManager.calculatePerformanceMetrics();
}
```

### Performance Metrics Integration:
```javascript
// Phase 4: Update adaptive performance manager with current metrics
if (FEATURE_FLAGS.USE_LOD_SYSTEM && adaptivePerformanceManager) {
  adaptivePerformanceManager.updateMetrics(
    fps, frameTime, memoryUsage, workerTime, renderTime, souls.length
  );
  
  // Update current quality from adaptive manager
  currentQuality = adaptivePerformanceManager.getCurrentQuality();
  
  // Update LOD distances if quality changed
  if (lodManager) {
    lodManager.configureForQuality(currentQuality);
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
- **FPS Improvement**: 30-50% through distance-based culling and LOD reduction
- **Memory Reduction**: 20% through optimized object management
- **Adaptive Quality**: Real-time quality adjustment based on hardware performance

### LOD Configuration by Quality Level:
- **Ultra/High**: Medium LOD at 30-40 units, Low at 60-80 units, Culled at 120-150 units
- **Medium**: Medium LOD at 25 units, Low at 50 units, Culled at 100 units  
- **Low**: Medium LOD at 20 units, Low at 40 units, Culled at 80 units
- **Minimal**: Medium LOD at 15 units, Low at 30 units, Culled at 60 units

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

### ✅ Verified Components:
- ✅ LOD Manager instantiation and initialization
- ✅ Adaptive Performance Manager integration
- ✅ Animation loop integration without breaking existing functionality
- ✅ Feature flag control working correctly
- ✅ Performance display showing LOD statistics
- ✅ No syntax errors or runtime issues

### 🎮 Live Testing:
- ✅ Application starts successfully with LOD system enabled
- ✅ FPS counter displays LOD statistics in real-time
- ✅ Quality level adapts based on performance
- ✅ Console logging shows proper initialization

## 📈 Next Steps (Step 2)
