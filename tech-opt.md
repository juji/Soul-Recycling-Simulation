## Svelte 5 Runes Migration

The project has been **fully migrated** from Svelte 4 legacy reactive syntax to Svelte 5's modern runes system:

### Migration Completion Status

âœ… **Reactive State Migration** - All `let` variables converted to `$state()`  
âœ… **Reactive Statements Migration** - All `$:` statements converted to `$effect()` and `$derived()`  
âœ… **Component Props Migration** - All `export let` props converted to `$props()` with `$bindable()`  
âœ… **Event Handler Updates** - All legacy event syntax updated to modern syntax  
âœ… **Critical Bug Fixes** - Resolved infinite effect loops and NaN errors  
âœ… **Performance Optimization** - Worker message handler O(nÂ²) â†’ O(1) optimization  
âœ… **Browser Compatibility** - Fixed passive event listener warnings  

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. Infinite Effect Loop Fix
**Problem**: `$effect()` was causing `effect_update_depth_exceeded` errors due to reactive state updates causing infinite loops.

**Solution**: Moved performance tracking to animation loop to break the reactive dependency chain.
